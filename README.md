# Project Description (Case Study)

This project has been developed as a case study using the /users endpoint of the JSONPlaceholder API service.

## Features

* The main screen displays users' names and email information in a list format.
* Tapping on a user opens a detail screen showing the selected user's name, email, phone number, and website information.

# Requirements

* iOS 17.0+
* Xcode 15.0+
* No additional installation required as no third-party dependencies are used.

# How to Run

* Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/tunimba/JSONPlaceholderAPICaseStudy.git or download the project files.
* Open the .xcodeproj file in the project folder by double-clicking to launch in Xcode.
* From the Xcode menu, select your target iPhone or simulator (Example: iPhone 14 Pro).
* Press the "Run" (â–º) button.


# Additional Notes

* Internet connection is required for the app's full functionality (API calls). However, mock data is provided in code to support testing and SwiftUI previews in offline scenarios.
* The code is designed with testability in mind, however, unit tests were not implemented due to time constraints.
